            <h5>What's the difference between local storage and session storage?</h5>
            <p>Ans: Local storage and session storage both stays in browser as storage.if tab or window is closed local
                storage
                still stays as same but in session storage removed.Local storage doesn't expire whereas, session storage
                expires.In local storage data is saved untill you clear them but in session it will automatically removes
                data
                after ending a session. </p>
            <h5>What's the difference between global and block scope?</h5>
            <p>Ans:Within Global scope , variables that are declared outside of any function are in global scope.It is
                accessible from any where in the code and In block scope,when variables are called within the "{ curly
                bracket }" that are block scope and those variables are only accessible inside the block. </p>
            <h5>How does the event loop works in Javascript?</h5>
            <p>Ans: Event loop has a task to look at the stack and task queue. When all of the tasks are executed in stack ,
                when stacks remain empty it takes the first task from task queue and pushes on the stack to execute it. </p>
            <h5>How many ways we get undifined?</h5>
            <p>Ans:8 ways to get undifined.
    
                1.variables which is not initializied.
                2.function with no return will give undifined.
                3.parameter which is not passed in function wil give undifined.
                4.if return has nothing on right side (what will be return if that is not defined then the value will be
                undifined).
                5.property that doesn't exist in object will give undefined.
                6.accessing array elements out of the index range will give undifined.
                7. after deleting array element explicitly will create a hole inside array and when you retrive the value of
                that deleted index will give undifined.
                8.set a value direactly to undifined. </p>
